* Implementing set_landmask
** CPP 
   1) First we need a new mask_name, so put that in mask_name.txt
   2) Then we need global to obtain the new mask and put in an array
   3) Again we distribute the landmask using distributeLandMask()
   4) Then we need a dedicated fortran routine to set the mask, not usrc::init

** Fortran
   On the fortran part it seems that after we set a new landmask we need to
  - call vmix_init 
  - call forcing
