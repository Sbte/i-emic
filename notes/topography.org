* Implementing get_landmask and set_landmask

*** We need a routine to get a mask
   1) Name of a mask gives a mask_name, so put that in mask_name.txt
   2) Use global.F90 to obtain the new mask and put in an array
   3) Distribute the landmask using distributeLandMask()

*** We need a routine to set a mask
	For this we need a dedicated fortran routine to set the mask, not usrc::init

*** Fortran: set_landmask
	On the fortran part it seems that after we set a new landmask we need to
    - call vmix_init 
    - call forcing
